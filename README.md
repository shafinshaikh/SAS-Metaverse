QuantumVerse - A 3D Metaverse NFT Project
QuantumVerse is an innovative Metaverse project leveraging Ethereum blockchain to create and manage unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represented as buildings within a virtual world. This project uses Solidity for smart contract development and Three.js for rendering 3D graphics in the web browser.

Features
NFT Building Management: Users can mint and manage unique building NFTs.
3D Visualization: Buildings are visualized in a 3D Metaverse, allowing users to interact with and explore the virtual environment.
Ethereum Blockchain Integration: Smart contract functionality for secure and decentralized NFT management.
Project Structure
QuantumVerse.sol: The Solidity smart contract for NFT creation and management.
index.js: The main JavaScript file for the web application, handling 3D rendering.
connect.js: JavaScript file to connect to Ethereum blockchain and interact with the smart contract.
KeyInput.js: Utility file for handling keyboard inputs in the web application.
abi/: Directory containing the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
Metamask extension installed in your browser.
An Ethereum wallet with some Ether (for deploying the contract and minting NFTs).
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuantumVerse.git
cd QuantumVerse
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract:

Update the QuantumVerse.sol file with your Ethereum wallet address.
Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby testnet).
Configure the Web Application:

Update the connect.js with the deployed contract address and ABI.
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the application through http://localhost:3000 or the configured port.

Usage
Open the web application in a browser.
Connect your Metamask wallet.
Interact with the UI to mint and view building NFTs in the 3D Metaverse.
